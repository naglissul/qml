# Bachelor thesis plan

Thesis topic: "Variational quantum eigensolver algorithm performance analysis on various molecules"

> What should be constant and what should be investigated as a variable? Read papers, what doesn't have an effect. Or maybe even just take one.

> What should be the EVALUATORS for evaluating efficiency? Time? Theoretical time? Accuracy? Circuit depth? Decoherence?

Molecules: $H_2$, $LiH$, $He$, $BeH_2$ ...?

Ansatze: UCCSD and it's modifications, Hardware specific (and that's it???)

Optimizers: L_BFGS_B and other ???

Environment: AER simulator, IBM quantum hardware (brisbane and other???), ???; qiskit, other???

Second quantization mappers (fermionic operators): Parity, Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev.
