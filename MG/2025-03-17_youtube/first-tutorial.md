# Chapter 1: What is QC?

---

## Classical logic gates

---

## X, Y gates

NOT gates...

---

## H, R_x, R_y gates

Probability gates... SUPERPOSITION.

---

### Quick break: practise

H=, X=, Y=, R_x=, R_y=,

Z=, R_z=

Given diagram, calculate final state and probabilities of 1 and 0.

---

## Magical _phase_ and Z, R_z gates

Bloch sphere

Formula...

What does phase do?

---

## Idea of Superdense coding

Alice and Bob...

---

## Entanglement

---

## All Bell states & reversibility

---

## Another way build Bell states

---

## Superdense coding process (example)

> 01 example

---

### Quick break: try yourself

Choose whatever 2 bits you want to send to the person next to you...

---

## End of chapter 1

Both angle and phase HAVE PURPOSE.
