# Have read through

[Finding Ground State Energy of Molecules with Variational Quantum Eigensolver (2019)](https://cs269q.stanford.edu/projects2019/KangLeeVQE_Y.pdf)

Not a real paper, just a project of students.

Evaluates:

- Speed - number of quantum gates
- Accuracy - calculated $E_0$ compared with actual $E_0$ from Schrodinger equation (classically)
