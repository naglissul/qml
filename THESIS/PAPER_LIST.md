## Have read through

[Finding Ground State Energy of Molecules with Variational Quantum Eigensolver (2019)](https://cs269q.stanford.edu/projects2019/KangLeeVQE_Y.pdf)

Not a real paper, just a project of students.

Evaluates:

- Speed - number of quantum gates
- Accuracy - calculated $E_0$ compared with actual $E_0$ from Schrodinger equation (classically)

## "General quantum read"

Metrics etc.

...

## "VQE read"

Falls right into the scope.

...

## "VQE maybe if have time"

Would be a great bachelor paper extension...

...

## "VQE more"

Interesting, not out of scope...
