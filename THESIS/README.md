VQE algorithm performance analysis on various molecules

- [Paper in progress, official plan](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zpvkyxyfzpmn#c1c979)
- [Running basic case of QC on simulator & hardware, estimator & sampler](./../GENERAL/qiskit-tryouts/RUNNING_BASIC_CIRCUIT.ipynb)
- [Running VQE on simulator & hardware](./R!-run-on-q-hardware/R1-run-on-q-hardware.ipynb), the latter has problems, documented [here](./R!-run-on-q-hardware/Failing_vqe_case.ipynb)

## Plan

Official plan (far from reality):

- (21 March 2025) Conduct literature analysis on the whole VQE algorithm process and variations, finding recommendations on what ans√§tze, classical optimizer, second quantization methods.
- (4 April 2025) Conduct literature analysis, determining which molecules, how and on what quantum and classical hardware can be tested. What is the performance of VQE on different molecule data input, as of today, what are the perceived possibilities on implementing this algorithm in computational chemistry, what are the limitations.
- (18 April 2025) Test theoretical literature analysis outcome on quantum hardware, comparing the results.
- (2 May 2025) Conduct empirical experiment with selected molecule data on selected devices.
- (16 May 2025) Performing analysis on empirical data, yielding conclusions on current possibilities and limitations.

Official deadlines:

- **2025-05-23 10:00 Hand in**

Actual plan:

1. In parallel:

- run VQE algorithm on IBMQ hardware (and other devices)
- write introduction (briefly read and familiarize with a lot of articles; list experiments and metrics, possibly will change)

2. In parallel:

- Read in detail literature analysis (and possibly change list of experiments and metrics)
- Write methodology
- Do experiments

3. Finalize...
